WARG image stitcher (http://warg-explorer16-autopilot.googlecode.com/) path calculations
Features:
- random map generation
- dump cubic Bezier splines from .blend
- exact evaluation for B(t), B'(t), and B''(t) (t is not time)
- memoizing arclength, speed, and speed' calculation using quadrature integration
- arclength reparameterization (i.e. displacement as a function of time at constant/configurable speed)
- compute transformation matrices from one point to another
- reconstruct map from consecutive images along the path
To do:
- fix rpy equations
- simplify matrix calculations
- eliminate the factor of 1.057...
- use HSI instead of writing .pto
